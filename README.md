# PiPico
## 1. Description

This is a collection of MicroPython-scripts to interface various sensors and devices with the Raspberry Pi Pico. It is intended for personal use to keep track of how to handle the different sensors and devices I own as a part of learning how to do these things. It will slowly be filled with scripts, schematics and datasheets, as well with some form of documentation.
